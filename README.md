# Notes and Reference for Robin Ln.

The following are some notes and reference materials for maintenance and management for our home at Robin Ln.

# Air Conditioning
In the garage closet, there are replacement AC unit capacitors and throw switches. These are VERY easy to replace and represent the most common ailments an AC unit can have. Simply remove the breaker/plug to be sure the electricity is off, then unscrew and replace the capacitor/switch. If you do not feel comfortable replacing these (or don't know if the capacitor is even the problem...hint, if the top/bottom of the capicitor is convexed or "blown out" then it's definitely bad), schedule a home waranty visit.

Please be sure to replace the air filters upstairs every three months suring the cool season and once a month during the summer. Feel free to use the cheapest filters you can buy as these are actually better for the furnace/blower unit than the "allergy" style filters and need to be changed less frequently. 

# Evaporative Cooler
The evaporative (swamp) cooler (EC) is great during the pre and post summer months when the temp is 90 or below outside. There are a few things to know about the cooler:

- It is an Australian style cooler and is located in the upstairs loft.
- There is a water feed line that runs from the cooler down to the water connection on the side of the house. This line feeds the cooler. There is another drain line that runs the same path but has a small funnel on the end. This is used to flush out sediment in the water (minerals, etc.). This funnel need to be pulled off and cleaned on occasion. If when the cooler is on and there is not a small stream of water flowing from it, it needs to be cleaned.
- Once a year, the cooler should be flushed. To do this, go out onto the upstairs balcony and use s screwdriver (electric will work best) and remove the five or six screws holding the main body of the cooler on. Once off, use a rope to lift the hose up from the side of the house and use it to flush out the dirt and build up in the cooler. Physically loosening the caked on minerals will help. In the bottom right of the cooler, there is a plug that allows the drain line through. Remove the plastic nut from the bottom and remove the plug to let the water drain. You have to kind of shimmy the main cylindrical threaded tube to get it out. Be sure to put everything back. There is typically some leaking here but if water leaks enough to start to pool, you know something is wrong.
- ECs operate very differently then AC units. When the EC is running, there must be an open window/door somewhere else in the home. Because the EC is blowing air into the home and creating positive air pressure, that pressure must be released out a window/door. Which window/door you chose to open depends on where you want the cool air to flow to. Only open the window/door slightly (maybe 4-5 inches) so that enough air escapes without letting warm outside air in. Running the EC with all other windows/door closed will eventually break the EC motor.

# Paint

# Pests
Yes, there are scorpions. On average, we will find 2-3 in the house each year. Typically, we find them around the stairs and/or in the laundry room/kitchen. We have found that the best strategy is protection in layers:

- Spray both perimeters (along the outside house and perimeter wall) with a good poison every three months. We use [this one and spray ourselves](https://www.amazon.com/Cy-Kick-Controlled-Release-Cyfluthrin-Insecticide/dp/B002ACMKV8/ref=sr_1_1?s=lawn-garden&ie=UTF8&qid=1494827699&sr=1-1&keywords=scorpion+poison) though you can hire a company. 
- Set a number of sticky traps inside the house along main walls. We don't do this in the garage as we typically only catch good pests like lizards there. 
- During scorpion season, go outside after dark and hunt them with a black light. Get a beefy one that lights up a large area [like this one](https://www.amazon.com/Focuspet-Flashlight-Blacklight-Furniture-batteries/dp/B01MR19UWG/ref=sr_1_12?s=hardware&ie=UTF8&qid=1494827942&sr=1-12&keywords=black+light). They become very easy to see even across the yard. Dispatch however you like. We use a long stick and/or scissors (no mercy). Over a year, we will typically kill about 10-15 outside.

Flys and mosquitoes are of course somewhat common. The backyard screen door was just replaced (5/2017) so you should be good there. Aside from that, we've never had an ant problem or any other kind of infestation. The home was treated for termites in 2015 and is very much still under that warranty. 

- 2018: This year I got an early start on scorpion hunting and killed about 8 in May once the temps started hitting 90+. I believe this had a very positive effect as come July and beyond, I did not see a single scorpion outside and this is the first year I never found any inside. I'm guessing I cut the reproducing population and thus no babies!

# Pool
You are more than welcome to hire a pool service to maintain the pool. However, it's pretty easy to maintain on your own and save some money. The routine we typically follow is:

- Running the pump/filter every night is expensive and not completely necessary. We typically run it for about 3 hours in the middle of the night Fri-Sun. This makes it available for weekend swimming while reducing electricity use during the week.
- Friday afternoon/evening, use the pool brush attachment to sweep the sides of the pool. Start at the waterline and brush the tiles in a downward motion until you hit the bottom. Do this all around the pool covering all sides of the pool. It should only take you maybe 10min. This physically removes any algae growth.
- Once the sides have been scrubbed, shock the pool using one packet of pool shock (for 10,000 gallon pools). We use: [this one](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DJ7CNT2/ref=sxr_rr_xsim_1?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_p=2795440402&pd_rd_wg=Gocjx&pf_rd_r=C71CP24541130VQ3B33W&pf_rd_s=desktop-rhs-carousels&pf_rd_t=301&pd_rd_i=B00DJ7CNT2&pd_rd_w=SzMN7&pf_rd_i=shock&pd_rd_r=D7RDCF8WXR9793NSXVQ0&ie=UTF8&qid=1494827243&sr=1). Walk around the pool and slowly dump the contents along the border.
- Finally, refresh the chlorine tablets in the floater. We typically use 2-3/week or so.

That's about it. If you do this religiously during the summer months, you should be fine. If needed, take a water sample to Leslies Pool Supply and they will test it for free and tell you what you need to do to fix any issues. Typically, we spend < $200/year on chemicals. Far cheaper than hiring someone. During cooler weather (November through March/April), you typically only have to do the above once a month. The pump filters were just cleaned in May 2017 and won't need to be cleaned for at least another year.

If you go swimming at night during the summer months, be sure to scan the pool and surrounding area with a black light for scorps.

The pool fence is removable. Simply unlock the metal clips at the top of the poles then pull the pole out of the hole. In one of the garage cabinets, there are caps to put in the holes if you wish to remove the gate long term. 

Both pool pumps were replaced in 2018. One is a refurb unit (black) while the other is a genuine [Pentair 075234S](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002NMW2GI/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1). If there is ever a problem with the pump, especially the black one as it is very noisy and will likely fail again, please purchase the OEM Pentair. It is super quiet.

# Washer/Dryer
Washer: Samsung WF363BTBEUF/A2 and parts can be found [here](https://www.samsungparts.com/Products/Parts_and_Accessories/WF363BTBEUF/A2/Default.aspx) 

- 2019-01-06: Pressure sensor and both hot/cold water valves were replaced after the unit was randomly reporting an 1E error code. 

# Security System
In the downstairs closet is the security system. The panel is located in the laundry room. The house is hardwired with a Honeywell Vista 20P that can be connected to a land line and a security monitoring service. 

# Water Filter
The home is equiped with a GE Profile PNRQ20FBL reverse osmosis system that feeds the drinking water faucet at the sink as well as the water going into the refridgerator (water and ice). The filters were changed a few months ago and won't need to be changed until probably the end of the year (2017). Really, only the carbon and pre-filter need to be changed as the membrane filter is good for at least a year or more.

# Water Softener
The home is equiped with a GE water softener in the garage. There is very little maintenance to perform aside from filling it with water softerner salt. A 40lb bag is about $5 from Home Depot and will fill the softerner about 1/3 of the way. Do not fill the tank completely. Leave the salt level at about 1/2 way as this will help if you need to break a [salt bridge](https://www.waterstoresgroup.com/resources/Removing-Breaking-Salt-Bridge.pdf) at the bottom of the tank. When filing the tank, be sure to adjust the salt level to the correct number/mark.

# Yard Maintenance
You can of course hire yard maintenance. However, should you like to take care of it yourselves, we have left a number of tools in the garage for help with yard maintenance. The summer months are, of course, the most busy in terms of plant growth. Shrubs should be trimmed with the electric trimmer with the clippings blown/gathered and trashed. Palm trees need occational pruning (maybe 2-3 times a year) and can be done with a tall tree saw/clipper. Currently, said trimmer is at my mother's home off Beardsley and 83rd. Please let me know if you would like to use it and I will arrange a pickup! 

In the fall/winter months, there is often a lot of dead leaf buildup on the rocks and under the shrubs. Using the leaf blower in the garage makes easy work of this. It definitely makes a mess and is a lot more than it first seems but clearing this out will help water get to the shrubs better and also discourage pests like scorpions from hiding out under there.

Sometimes, an irrigation tip will become plugged and water will no longer flow from it. I have left a few of these in the garage closet as well. Please check these every few months to be sure that all plants have water. On the rare occation, an underground main irrigation line will develop a crack. The most obvious sign is a crapload of water flowing seemingly out of the ground. I have left pleanty of mainline irrigation tubing in the garage closet. Should you desire to fix this yourself, you must simply dig up the ricks/dirt around the leak exposing the cracked line. Cut the line completely, then use a [compression coupling](https://www.dripdepot.com/item/compression-tubing-coupling?gdffi=cf83ccffd3ab412e9fd6fb117dbb26c9&gdfms=9ACBF5313FAF407A99F0CD7F49C24F55&gclid=Cj0KEQjwo-XIBRCOycL7hsuI_NoBEiQAuS6HtKDyfNKxyNI3RQLwkeQZ3Iw52SGE5M189FnqU_x_DgYaAiN98P8HAQ) to patch the two sides together. We will of course reimburse for any expenses. Alternatively, you can just let us know about the leak and we'll have someone come out to fix it!

The HOA will notify us both pretty quickly of weed overgrowth so be sure to keep that undercontrol. It's really only a problem after heavy rains.
