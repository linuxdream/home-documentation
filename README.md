# Notes and Reference for Robin Ln.

The following are some notes and reference materials for maintenance and management for our home at Robin Ln.

# Air Conditioning
In the garage closet, there are replacement AC unit capacitors and throw switches. These are VERY easy to replace and represent the most common ailments an AC unit can have. Simply remove the breaker/plug to be sure the electricity if off, then unscrew and replace the capacitor/switch. If you do not feel comfortable replacing these (or don't know if the capacitor is even the problem...hint, if the top/bottom of the capicitor is convexed or "blown out" then it's definitely bad), schedule a home waranty visit. 

Please be sure to replace the air filters upstairs every three months suring the cool season and once a month during the summer. Feel free to use the cheapest filters you can buy as these are actually better for the furnace/blower unit than the "allergy" style filters and need to be changed less frequently. 

# Evaporative Cooler
The evaporative (swamp) cooler (EC) is great during the pre and post summer months when the temp is 90 or below outside. There are a few things to know about the cooler:

- It is an Australian style cooler and is located in the upstairs loft.
- There is a water feed line that runs from the cooler down to the water connection on the side of the house. This line feeds the cooler. There is another drain line that runs the same path but has a small funnel on the end. This is used to flush out sediment in the water (minerals, etc.). This funnel need to be pulled off and cleaned on occasion. If when the cooler is on and there is not a small stream of water flowing from it, it needs to be cleaned.
- Once a year, the cooler should be flushed. To do this, go out onto the upstairs balcony and use s screwdriver (electric will work best) and remove the five or six screws holding the main body of the cooler on. Once off, use a rope to lift the hose up from the side of the house and use it to flush out the dirt and build up in the cooler. Physically loosening the caked on minerals will help. In the bottom right of the cooler, there is a plug that allows the drain line through. Remove the plastic nut from the bottom and remove the plug to let the water drain. You have to kind of shimmy the main cylindrical threaded tube to get it out. Be sure to put everything back. There is typically some leaking here but if water leaks enough to start to pool, you know something is wrong.
- ECs operate very differently then AC units. When the EC is running, there must be an open window/door somewhere else in the home. Because the EC is blowing air into the home and creating positive air pressure, that pressure must be released out a window/door. Which window/door you chose to open depends on where you want the cool air to flow to. Only open the window/door slightly (maybe 4-5 inches) so that enough air escapes without letting warm outside air in. Running the EC with all other windows/door closed will eventually break the EC motor.

# Paint

# Pests
Yes, there are scorpions. On average, we will find 2-3 in the house. Typically, we find them around the stairs and/or in the laundry room/kitchen. We have found that the best strategy is protection in layers:

- Spray both perimeters (along the outside house and perimeter wall) with a good poison every three months. We use [this one and spray ourselves](https://www.amazon.com/Cy-Kick-Controlled-Release-Cyfluthrin-Insecticide/dp/B002ACMKV8/ref=sr_1_1?s=lawn-garden&ie=UTF8&qid=1494827699&sr=1-1&keywords=scorpion+poison) though you can hire a company. 
- Set a number of sticky traps inside the house along main walls. We don't do this in the garage as we typically only catch good pests like lizards there. 
- During scorpion season, go outside after dark and hunt them with a black light. Get a beefy one that lights up a large area [like this one](https://www.amazon.com/Focuspet-Flashlight-Blacklight-Furniture-batteries/dp/B01MR19UWG/ref=sr_1_12?s=hardware&ie=UTF8&qid=1494827942&sr=1-12&keywords=black+light). They become very easy to see even across the yard. Dispatch however you like. We use a long stick and/or scissors. Over a year, we will typically kill about 10-15 outside.

# Pool
You are more than welcome to hire a pool service to maintain the pool. However, it's pretty easy to maintain on your own and save some money. The routine we typically follow is:

- Running the pump/filter every night is expensive and not completely necessary. We typically run it for about 3 hours in the middle of the night Fri-Sun. This makes it available for weekend swimming while reducing electricity use during the week.
- Friday afternoon/evening, use the pool brush attachment to sweep the sides of the pool. Start at the waterline and brush the tiles in a downward motion until you hit the bottom. Do this all around the pool. It should only take you maybe 10min. This physically removes any algae growth.
- Once the sides have been scrubbed, shock the pool using one packet of pool shock (for 10,000 gallon pools). We use: [this one](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DJ7CNT2/ref=sxr_rr_xsim_1?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_p=2795440402&pd_rd_wg=Gocjx&pf_rd_r=C71CP24541130VQ3B33W&pf_rd_s=desktop-rhs-carousels&pf_rd_t=301&pd_rd_i=B00DJ7CNT2&pd_rd_w=SzMN7&pf_rd_i=shock&pd_rd_r=D7RDCF8WXR9793NSXVQ0&ie=UTF8&qid=1494827243&sr=1). Walk around the pool and slowly dump the contents along the border.
- Finally, refresh the chlorine tablets in the floater. We typically use 2-3/week or so.

That's about it. If you do this religiously during the summer months, you should be fine. If needed, take a water sample to Leslies Pool Supply and they will test it for free and tell you what you need to do to fix any issues. Typically, we spend < $200/year on chemicals. Far cheaper than hiring someone. During cooler weather (November through March/April), You typically only have to do the above once a month. The pump filters were just cleaned in May 2017 and won't need to be cleaned for at least another year.

If you go swimming at night during the summer months, be sure to scan the pool and surrounding area with a black light.
