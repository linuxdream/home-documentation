### Pool
You are more than welcome to hire a pool service to maintain the pool. However, it's pretty easy to maintain on your own and save some money. The routine we typically follow is:

- Running the pump/filter every night is expensive and not completely necessary. We typically run it for about 3 hours in the middle of the night Fri-Sun. This makes it available for weekend swimming.
- Friday afternoon/evening, use the pool brush attachment to sweep the sides of the pool. Start at the waterline and brush the tiles in a downward motion until you hit the bottom. Do this all around the pool. It should only take you maybe 10min. This physically removes any algae growth.
